But then his Lord recalled him, and pardoned him, and guided him.\qt@no{(122)}}%

The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. She was about to disclose him, had We not steadied her heart, that she may remain a believer.\qt@no{(10)}}%

\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxvii{%
It is We who revive the dead; and We write down what they have forwarded, and their traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear Record.\qt@no{(12)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxviii{%
And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town—when the messengers came to it.\qt@no{(13)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxix{%
We sent them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third. They said, “We are messengers to you.”\qt@no{(14)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxx{%
They said, “You are nothing but humans like us, and the Gracious did not send down anything; you are only lying.”\qt@no{(15)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxi{%
They said, “Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you.\qt@no{(16)}}%

And our only duty is clear communication.”\qt@no{(17)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxiii{%
They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if you do not give up, we will stone you, and a painful punishment from us will befall you.”\qt@no{(18)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxiv{%
They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is it because you were reminded? But you are an extravagant people.”\qt@no{(19)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxv{%
Then a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said, “O my people, follow the messengers.\qt@no{(20)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxvi{%
Follow those who ask you of no wage, and are themselves guided.\qt@no{(21)}}%

“And why should I not worship Him Who created me, and to Whom you will be returned?\qt@no{(22)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxviii{%
Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If the Merciful desires harm for me, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor will they save me.\qt@no{(23)}}%

In that case, I would be completely lost.\qt@no{(24)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxx{%
I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me.”\qt@no{(25)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxi{%
It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If only my people knew.\qt@no{(26)}}%

How my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honored.”\qt@no{(27)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxiii{%
After him, We sent down no hosts from heaven to his people; nor would We ever send any down.\qt@no{(28)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxiv{%
It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.\qt@no{(29)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxv{%
Alas for the servants. No messenger ever came to them, but they ridiculed him.\qt@no{(30)}}%

\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxvii{%
All of them, every single one of them, will be arraigned before Us.\qt@no{(32)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxviii{%
And there is a sign for them in the dead land: We give it life, and produce from it grains from which they eat.\qt@no{(33)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxxxix{%
And We place in it gardens of palm-trees and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.\qt@no{(34)}}%

Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; of what the earth produces, and of their own selves, and of what they do not know.\qt@no{(36)}}%

Another sign for them is the night: We strip the day out of it—and they are in darkness.\qt@no{(37)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxliii{%
And the sun runs towards its destination. Such is the design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\qt@no{(38)}}%

And the moon: We have disposed it in phases, until it returns like the old twig.\qt@no{(39)}}%

The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an orbit.\qt@no{(40)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxlvi{%
Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden Ark.\qt@no{(41)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxlvii{%
And We created for them the like of it, in which they ride.\qt@no{(42)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccxlviii{%
If We will, We can drown them—with no screaming to be heard from them, nor will they be saved.\qt@no{(43)}}%

And when it is said to them, “Spend of what God has provided for you,” those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we feed someone whom God could feed, if He so willed? You must be deeply misguided.”\qt@no{(47)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccliii{%
And they say, “When will this promise be, if you are truthful?”\qt@no{(48)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmdccliv{%
All they can expect is a single blast, which will seize them while they feud.\qt@no{(49)}}%

They will not be able to make a will, nor will they return to their families.\qt@no{(50)}}%

The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.\qt@no{(51)}}%

It will be but a single scream; and behold, they will all be brought before Us.\qt@no{(53)}}%

That Day will be a difficult day.\qt@no{(9)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdv{%
For the disbelievers—not easy.\qt@no{(10)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdvi{%
Leave Me to him whom I created alone.\qt@no{(11)}}%

I will exhaust him increasingly.\qt@no{(17)}}%

He thought and analyzed.\qt@no{(18)}}%

Then he turned back and was proud.\qt@no{(23)}}%

It neither leaves, nor spares.\qt@no{(28)}}%

It scorches the flesh.\qt@no{(29)}}%

Over it are Nineteen.\qt@no{(30)}}%

We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Scripture may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, “What did God intend by this parable?” Thus God leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is nothing but a reminder for the mortals.\qt@no{(31)}}%

Nay! By the moon.\qt@no{(32)}}%

As though they were panicked donkeys.\qt@no{(50)}}%

Fleeing from a lion?\qt@no{(51)}}%

When vision is dazzled.\qt@no{(7)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdlix{%
And the moon is eclipsed.\qt@no{(8)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdlx{%
And the sun and the moon are joined together.\qt@no{(9)}}%

No indeed! There is no refuge.\qt@no{(11)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdlxiii{%
To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.\qt@no{(12)}}%

On that Day man will be informed of everything he put forward, and everything he left behind.\qt@no{(13)}}%

And man will be evidence against himself.\qt@no{(14)}}%

Even as he presents his excuses.\qt@no{(15)}}%

Alas, you love the fleeting life.\qt@no{(20)}}%

Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen them.\qt@no{(25)}}%

And it is said, “Who is the healer?”\qt@no{(27)}}%

Woe to you; and woe.\qt@no{(34)}}%

Then again: Woe to you; and woe.\qt@no{(35)}}%

Does man think that he will be left without purpose?\qt@no{(36)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdlxxxviii{%
Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?\qt@no{(37)}}%

Then he became a clot. And He created and proportioned?\qt@no{(38)}}%

We guided him to the way, be he appreciative or unappreciative.\qt@no{(3)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdxcv{%
We have prepared for the faithless chains, and yokes, and a Searing Fire.\qt@no{(4)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdxcvi{%
But the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is aroma.\qt@no{(5)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdxcvii{%
A spring from which the servants of God will drink, making it gush abundantly.\qt@no{(6)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdxcviii{%
They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day whose ill is widespread.\qt@no{(7)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmdxcix{%
And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, and the orphan, and the captive.\qt@no{(8)}}%

“We only feed you for the sake of God. We want from you neither compensation, nor gratitude.\qt@no{(9)}}%

Crystal of silver—they measured them exactly.\qt@no{(16)}}%

The freeing of a slave.\qt@no{(13)}}%
