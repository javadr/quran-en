So they went on until when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they found in it a wall which was on the point of falling, so he put it into a right state. (Musa) said: If you had pleased, you might certainly have taken a recompense for it.\qt@no{(77)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxviii{%
He said: This shall be separation between me and you; now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience.\qt@no{(78)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxix{%
As for the boat, it belonged to (some) poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized every boat by force.\qt@no{(79)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxx{%
And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them:\qt@no{(80)}}%

So we desired that their Lord might give them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion.\qt@no{(81)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxii{%
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father was a righteous man; so your Lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure, a mercy from your Lord, and I did not do it of my own accord. This is the significance of that with which you could not have patience.\qt@no{(82)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxiii{%
And they ask you about Zulqarnain. Say: I will recite to you an account of him.\qt@no{(83)}}%

Until when he reached the place where the sun set, he found it going down into a black sea, and found by it a people. We said: O Zulqarnain! either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit.\qt@no{(86)}}%

He said: As to him who is unjust, we will chastise him, then shall he be returned to his Lord, and He will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement:\qt@no{(87)}}%

And as for him who believes and does good, he shall have goodly reward, and We will speak to him an easy word of Our command.\qt@no{(88)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxix{%
Then he followed (another) course.\qt@no{(89)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxx{%
Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from It;\qt@no{(90)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxxi{%
Even so! and We had a full knowledge of what he had.\qt@no{(91)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxxii{%
Then he followed (another) course.\qt@no{(92)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxxiii{%
Until when he reached (a place) between the two mountains, he found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a word.\qt@no{(93)}}%

He said: That in which my Lord has established me is better, therefore you only help me with workers, I will make a fortified barrier between you and them;\qt@no{(95)}}%

Bring me blocks of iron; until when he had filled up the space between the two mountain sides, he said: Blow, until when he had made it (as) fire, he said: Bring me molten brass which I may pour over it.\qt@no{(96)}}%

So they were not able to scale it nor could they make a hole in it.\qt@no{(97)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmccxxxviii{%
He said: This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass He will make it level with the ground, and the promise of my Lord is ever true.\qt@no{(98)}}%

And on that day We will leave a part of them in conflict with another part, and the trumpet will be blown, so We will gather them all together;\qt@no{(99)}}%

Musa said to them: Woe to you! do not forge a lie against Allah, lest He destroy you by a punishment, and he who forges (a lie) indeed fails to attain (his desire).\qt@no{(61)}}%

So they disputed with one another about their affair and kept the discourse secret.\qt@no{(62)}}%

He said: Nay! cast down. then lo! their cords and their rods-- it was imaged to him on account of their magic as if they were running.\qt@no{(66)}}%

We said: Fear not, surely you shall be the uppermost,\qt@no{(68)}}%

And the magicians were cast down making obeisance; they said: We believe in the Lord of Haroun and Musa.\qt@no{(70)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxix{%
(Firon) said: You believe in him before I give you leave; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment, therefore I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will certainly crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and certainly you will come to know which of us is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising.\qt@no{(71)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxx{%
They said: We do not prefer you to what has come to us of clear arguments and to He Who made us, therefore decide what you are going to decide; you can only decide about this world's life.\qt@no{(72)}}%

Whoever comes to his Lord (being) guilty, for him is surely hell; he shall not die therein, nor shall he live.\qt@no{(74)}}%

And Firon followed them with his armies, so there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them.\qt@no{(78)}}%

He said: So surely We have tried your people after you, and the Samiri has led them astray.\qt@no{(85)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxxxiv{%
So Musa returned to his people wrathful, sorrowing. Said he: O my people! did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise: did then the time seem long to you, or did you wish that displeasure from your Lord should be due to you, so that you broke (your) promise to me?\qt@no{(86)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxxxv{%
They said: We did not break (our) promise to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of the people, then we made a casting of them, and thus did the Samiri suggest.\qt@no{(87)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxxxvi{%
So he brought forth for them a calf, a (mere) body, which had a mooing sound, so they said: This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot.\qt@no{(88)}}%

What! could they not see that it did not return to them a reply, and (that) it did not control any harm or benefit for them?\qt@no{(89)}}%

So that you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my order?\qt@no{(93)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxlii{%
He said: O son of my mother! seize me not by my beard nor by my head; surely I was afraid lest you should say: You have caused a division among the children of Israel and not waited for my word.\qt@no{(94)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxliii{%
He said: What was then your object, O Samiri?\qt@no{(95)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxliv{%
He said: I saw (Jibreel) what they did not see, so I took a handful (of the dust) from the footsteps of the messenger, then I threw it in the casting; thus did my soul commend to me\qt@no{(96)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdxlv{%
He said: Begone then, surely for you it will be in this life to say, Touch (me) not; and surely there is a threat for you, which shall not be made to fail to you, and look at your god to whose worship you kept (so long); we will certainly burn it, then we will certainly scatter it a (wide) scattering in the sea.\qt@no{(97)}}%

They shall consult together secretly: You did tarry but ten (centuries).\qt@no{(103)}}%

\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdlv{%
You shall not see therein any crookedness or unevenness.\qt@no{(107)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdlvi{%
On that day they shall follow the inviter, there is no crookedness in him, and the voices shall be low before the Beneficent Allah so that you shall not hear aught but a soft sound.\qt@no{(108)}}%

On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with.\qt@no{(109)}}%

He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge.\qt@no{(110)}}%

\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmcdlxi{%

And certainly We gave a commandment to Adam before, but he forgot; and We did not find in him any determination.\qt@no{(115)}}%

And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam, they made obeisance, but Iblis (did it not); he refused.\qt@no{(116)}}%

Then his Lord chose him, so He turned to him and guided (him).\qt@no{(122)}}%

He said: Get forth you two therefrom, all (of you), one of you (is) enemy to another. So there will surely come to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, he shall not go astray nor be unhappy;\qt@no{(123)}}%

And whoever turns away from My reminder, his shall be a straitened life, and We will raise him on the day of resurrection, blind.\qt@no{(124)}}%

He will say: Even so, Our communications came to you but you neglected them; even thus shall you be forsaken this day.\qt@no{(126)}}%
