A servant when he prays\qt@no{(10)}}%

Or enjoins Taqwa\qt@no{(12)}}%

Nay! If he ceases not, We will scorch his forehead --\qt@no{(15)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmmcxxii{%
A lying, sinful forehead!\qt@no{(16)}}%
\qt@newcmd\qurantrans@en@mmmmmmcxxiii{%
Then let him call upon his council.\qt@no{(17)}}%

Verily, those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and idolators, will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.\qt@no{(6)}}%
